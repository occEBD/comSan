# ===== Command Sanitizer Configuration =====
# Enhanced with Geyser (Bedrock Edition) and ViaConnect (cross-version) support

# Security Settings
# ----------------

# Should shell separators (;|&`$()) be escaped to spaces instead of blocking?
# Recommended: true for less strict enforcement, false for maximum security
escape-separators: true

# Allow URLs in commands?
# Bedrock clients may paste URLs more frequently - adjust based on your needs
# Recommended: false for security, true if you trust your players
allow-urls: false

# Maximum command length (in characters)
# Protects against DoS attacks and extremely long payloads
# Bedrock clients typically send shorter commands, but mobile paste could exceed this
# Default: 512 (reasonable for most commands)
# Increase if you have plugins with very long command arguments
max-command-length: 512


# Cross-Platform Compatibility
# ----------------------------

# Strip Bedrock Edition formatting codes (§ codes)?
# Bedrock clients may include § formatting codes that Java doesn't use
# Set to 'true' if you want to remove them, 'false' to preserve them
# Recommended: false (preserve them, they're harmless and allow color on Bedrock)
strip-bedrock-formatting: false


# User Messages
# -------------

# Message shown to players when their command is blocked
# Use § for color codes (§c = red, §e = yellow, etc.)
# \n creates a new line
